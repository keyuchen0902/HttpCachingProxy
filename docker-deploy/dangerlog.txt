1. Not all port "80" or "433" corresponding to CONNECT or GET, sometimes the browser 
request us to use the default port number for method like Get, but the target server 
does not accept port "80" for GET

2.If the buffer size is fixed, we found that we cannot receive all contents from client. 
We have to keep writing to our buffer first, then append the content to receive data, and
then empty the buffer, repeat receiving again.
also, if we found that the data is transferred by chunks, we need to repetitively receiving
chunks until the end of data piece.

3. All we consider is about HTTP/1.1. We did not care about other version. 

4.In order to make all threads have access to the same resource, we used mutex to implement 
synchronization. And we write a .h file called "lock.h" to implement the lock.

5. When we handle the time which means we need to get now time to compute the expiration time.
It is important that we need to minus the num of year 1990. And the month of the year minus 1 
in the function "add time".  create_time.tm_year = year - 1900;  create_time.tm_month= month - 1;
also, if we want to do addition on "time", we need to parse and extract it from string, and use
time_t to get time as seconds from 1900, then add seconds and convert it to struct tm.

6. For the header parsing part. We need to pay attention to the use of substr whose the second parameter
should be the length instead of position. And the format of http header ought to be paied more attention
especially the  blank after ":"
